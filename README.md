# Raspberry Pi + pywws = weather station

Here-in are some scripts and templates that I created whilst setting up my automated Raspberry Pi weather station. The hardware behind the scenes can all be purchased "off the shelf," and comprises of no more than:
* Raspberry Pi
* WH1080 Professional Weather Station

The main software that operates behind the scenes is [pywws](http://code.google.com/p/pywws/).
